Chimer slowly turns around, sweat trickling down his face. At that moment, he sees two white, flaming streaks in the shadows of the hallway, as if they were eyes watching him the entire time.

"Took you long enough to notice," the figure in the dark says as he steps out of his spot.

"W... Who are you?!" Chimer raises his guard and steps back.

The figure's full appearance slowly takes shape before Chimer's eyes. His black attire, blending into the darkness, gradually reveals itself under the light. The pitch-black, void-like flame on his head doesn't reflect light, unsettling Chimer even more as a sinister feeling stirs within him.

"Shh... you'll wake our roommate," the figure interrupts.

Chimer's eyes widen slightly at the statement, catching a suspicious detail. "Our...?" Chimer asks, but gets no answer.

Instead, the figure sits at the dining table, his head slumping onto the wooden surface with almost no sound. "Aghhhh, this is so tiring..."

This act confuses Chimer, but he slowly lets his guard down and approaches the figure, eventually sitting at the table with him. "W... What brings you here..?" he says cautiously and quietly, not wanting Midori to wake up.

The figure sighs and looks at Chimer with a serious gaze, clasping his hands and resting his chin on them. "I'm here for the cloth, Chimer."

"How do you know my name?" Chimer asks, surprised, his eyes widening.

"I know a lot about you, Chimer. Anyway, where is the cloth?" he asks calmly.

"Wait, I thought you already had it?" Chimer replies, remembering the time he touched the mark on the tree.

"Wait, what..?" the figure asks, confused, his eyes widening in surprise.

"You... you looked at me... and the cloth disappeared from my hands..." Chimer says, gesturing with his hand.

"Wha..." Suddenly, the figure gets a call on his phone and answers it, putting it up to his non-existent ear. "Yeah, what's up? ...It's there? Seriously?? ...Damn it." He hangs up and places his phone on the table, sighing. "...Yeah, you're right..." he says, disappointed.

The figure then stands up and prepares to leave. "Welp, sorry for wasting your time, buddy."

"...Wait." Chimer calls to the figure, his face showing a sense of insecurity. "How much do you know about me..?"

The figure looks over his shoulder, staring at Chimer for a few seconds before turning around, sitting back down, and sighing. "Guess I'll stick around for a bit. Now..."

"I know many things about you—your likes and dislikes, your strengths and weaknesses, and the events that caused you to tumble from the top of your company. Like, for example, the death of your family tree."

Chimer's face immediately turns to surprise and anger, his eyes widening at the mention of the one trauma he doesn't want to hear again. "Do not... ever..."

"And the fact that— H... Huh...?" the figure nervously says as he gets cut off. His eyes widen and a freezing chill runs down his spine.

"Ever... MENTION THEM!" Chimer's voice rises sharply as he slams his fist against the tabletop. His anger skyrockets as the figure jumps up from his seat.

At that moment, a groan escapes from a third person in the room. "Whuh...? Chimer...?" It turns out, Midori has awakened from her sleep.

The two immediately turn their heads toward Midori, with Chimer instantly regretting his outburst. "Oh shit," the figure curses, his eyes wide in fear of being spotted.

Midori rubs her eyes, still half-asleep, and looks around in confusion. "Chimer...? What's going on?" she mumbles, her gaze landing on the shadowy figure at the table. As her eyes adjust, she freezes, recognizing the unnatural flames flickering atop his head.

Midori starts screaming sharply as soon as she sees the figure. Chimer quickly moves to her side, trying to calm her. "Midori, it's okay. Just... calm down, and we can talk this out..."

The figure stands up, his expression softening as he looks at Midori. "No need to be afraid. My name is Sah," he says, bowing slightly. "I mean you no harm."

Midori clings to Chimer, her eyes wide with fear. "Who... what are you?"

Sah sighs, pulling out a chair and sitting down again. "I suppose you deserve an actual explanation now. I was once human, like you. But now, I roam the world in the shadows of the unknown void. My past is complicated, but that's not important right now."

He turns his gaze to Chimer, his tone growing serious. "You both need to be careful. There are people after you—dangerous people. They know about their comrade's deaths, and they won't stop until they get revenge on you, Chimer."

"Me? W-why me?" Chimer asks in confusion as he lets go of Midori.

"Because you were spotted at the scene of the murder. You're a witness, Chimer," Sah responds seriously.

Before Chimer can reply, the front door bursts open with a deafening crash. A group of armed men storms into the apartment, weapons drawn. Chimer and Midori are caught off guard, but Sah remains eerily calm.

One of the men grabs Midori, holding a weapon to her head. "Nobody move! We're here for the man!"

Sah's eyes narrow, a cold fury settling over him. "Let her go," he warns, his voice low and dangerous.

The men ignore him, tightening their grip on Midori. Chimer tries to intervene, but Sah raises a hand to stop him.

In a blur of motion, Sah teleports to the man holding Midori hostage and grabs him by the neck, choking him as he lifts him into the air. "I said 'let her go.'"

The other men immediately charge in with their weapons, but the lights flicker out as Sah's white features illuminate the darkness. His fists start turning white as white flames emerge from within them. Then, white streaks cut through the darkness in various places as Sah beats the men down in the dark. Screams and roars from the men eventually stop at the same time the lights come back on.

Sah stands in the center of the room, untouched. He glances at Chimer and Midori, his expression unreadable. "Stay safe," he says quietly, before turning and walking out the door. Within moments, he's gone—leaving only silence behind.

Now, only one question remained in Chimer's head: "Who really are these people, and why are they saving me?"
