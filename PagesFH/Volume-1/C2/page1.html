Chapter 2: Im Tired

"Mmmh..." Chimer groans as he walks past the receptionist, tired and exhausted from the long day.

"Have a good night, sir!" the receptionist says with a smile.

Chimer stops for a moment, looking over his shoulder. He hadn't really spoken to her much, but he really appreciated her kindness.

"Y... you too, Lena. Take care of yourself..." he replies, forcing a smile before continuing on his way.

"Dont worry about me, Chimer. You know how it is." Lena replies, her voice cheerful despite the late hour.
