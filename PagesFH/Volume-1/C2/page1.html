<h1>Chapter 2: I'm Tired</h1>

"Mmmh..." Chimer groans as he walks past the receptionist, tired and exhausted from the long day.

"Have a good night, sir!" the receptionist says with a smile.

Chimer stops for a moment, looking over his shoulder. He hadn't really spoken to her much, but he appreciated her kindness, even though he thought no one liked him.

"Y... you too, Lena. Take care of yourself..." he replies, forcing a smile before continuing on his way.

"Don't worry about me, Chimer. You know how it is," Lena replies, her voice cheerful despite the late hour.
