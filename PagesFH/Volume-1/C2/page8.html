Chimer tenses up, ready to either live or die. His hands tremble slightly from his remaining fear but he pushes all of it aside.

The assassins take one step back and point their weapons at the two individuals in front of them, about to shoot. However, the man in white steps in, running and moving in momentary flashes as he cuts and dices up each assassin with his white katana.

Chimer is left astounded by what was happening in front of him, causing him to drop his guard while an assassin crept up from behind.

As Chimer turned around, he saw a shocking sight; the man in white already behind the assassin who crept up on him.
