Chimer at this age was a bit more energetic but also lonely. He had a close friend to cling on to whenever he wanted, but now she frequently rejects him.

"Nell..! Please, just one hug..!" Young Chimer pleads desperately, wanting to satisfy his longing for affection.

"Chimer, just stop. I don't trust you anymore, after what you did to me," Nell replied with an irritated look on her face, her eyes screaming hate and rejection.

"I- I'm sorry... It was just an accident-" Chimer reasons, hoping to find forgiveness.
