His eyes widened immediately when he heard the voice whispering in his ear.

<span style="color:grey">"Chimer... you can't die just yet... I..."</span>

Suddenly, the sound of someone landing could be heard behind Chimer, getting the attention of Chimer and the assassins. It was a hooded man in white. His clothes, and hanging katana were all shining in white.

At this moment, Chimer felt a sense of determination boiling within him, getting him to stand up and face the assassins.

He gets into a rather peculiar fighting stance, his face turns serious as he raises his hands on guard.

"Come."
