That evening, back at Nell’s apartment, Chimer found his friends gathered around the kitchen table, sharing takeout and stories from their day. Midori was laughing at something Nell had said, her earlier fear replaced by a tentative smile. Chimer joined them, feeling a warmth he hadn’t felt in a long time.

As the night wore on, Chimer stepped out onto the balcony, looking out over the city. The rain had stopped, and the lights below twinkled like stars. He took a deep breath, feeling the strength in his arms, the steadiness in his heart.

He wasn’t alone anymore. He had people to protect, and now, maybe, the strength to do it.
