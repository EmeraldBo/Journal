The next morning, Chimer woke to the soft patter of rain against the window and the distant hum of city traffic. For a moment, he lay still, staring at the ceiling, letting the memories of the night before swirl in his mind—Sah’s warning, Lena’s worried eyes, the terror in Midori’s voice, and Zack’s cryptic words. He felt a strange mix of exhaustion and energy, as if something inside him had shifted.

He sat up, careful not to disturb Nell, who was curled up on the other side of the room, still asleep. Midori was sprawled on the couch, a blanket tangled around her legs. Chimer quietly dressed, pulling on his jacket and lacing up his shoes. He paused at the door, glancing back at his friends. For the first time in a long while, he felt a sense of responsibility—a need to protect, not just survive.

Outside, the city was waking up. The rain had eased to a drizzle, and the streets glistened with puddles reflecting neon signs and gray clouds. Chimer started walking, his breath visible in the chilly air. He replayed Sah’s words in his head: *There are people after you—dangerous people. They won’t stop until they get revenge.*

He clenched his fists, feeling the bruises from the night before. He was tired of running, tired of being afraid. He needed to change.

He broke into a jog, letting the rhythm of his footsteps clear his mind. He ran past shuttered shops and empty bus stops, past the alley where he’d first seen the man in white. He ran until his lungs burned and his legs ached, then slowed to a walk, wiping sweat from his brow.

He found himself outside a small park, the grass still wet from the rain. He sat on a bench, catching his breath, and watched a group of kids practicing soccer in the mud. Their laughter echoed across the field, carefree and bright. Chimer smiled, remembering a time when life was simpler.

His phone buzzed. A message from Nell:  
*“You okay? Where’d you go?”*

He typed back:  
*“Just needed some air. I’ll be back soon.”*

He pocketed his phone and stood, stretching his sore muscles. As he turned to leave, he noticed a flyer taped to a lamppost: *Marvin’s Dojo – Self-Defense Classes, All Levels Welcome.* He stared at it for a moment, then tore off one of the tabs with the address.

A short walk later, he stood in front of the dojo—a modest building squeezed between a bakery and a laundromat. He hesitated, nerves fluttering in his stomach, then pushed open the door.

Inside, the air smelled of sweat and old wood. Mats covered the floor, and a few heavy bags hung from the ceiling. A tall, broad-shouldered man was mopping the mats. He looked up, his face kind but serious.

“Morning,” the man said, setting the mop aside. “You here to train?”

Chimer nodded, suddenly self-conscious. “Yeah. I… I need to learn how to fight. Fast.”

The man smiled, extending a hand. “I’m Marvin. You look like you’ve had a rough night.”

Chimer shook his hand, feeling the strength in Marvin’s grip. “You could say that. I just… I need to be able to protect my friends.”

Marvin nodded, his expression softening. “That’s a good reason. Let’s start with the basics.”

They began slowly. Marvin showed Chimer how to stand, how to keep his balance, how to throw a punch without hurting himself. Chimer’s movements were awkward at first, his body stiff and uncertain. But Marvin was patient, correcting his form, encouraging him to keep going.

After an hour, Chimer was drenched in sweat, his arms trembling. He collapsed onto the mat, breathing hard.

Marvin sat beside him. “You’ve got heart, kid. That’s more important than strength.”

Chimer managed a tired smile. “I don’t feel strong. Not yet.”

“You will,” Marvin said. “Strength isn’t just about muscles. It’s about not giving up, even when you’re scared.”

Chimer nodded, letting the words sink in.

Over the next few days, Chimer returned to the dojo every morning. Sometimes Nell or Midori came with him, watching from the sidelines or practicing their own moves. Marvin taught them how to block, how to dodge, how to strike with purpose. Chimer’s body ached, but he kept pushing, driven by the memory of Sah’s warning and the fear in his friends’ eyes.

One afternoon, after a particularly tough session, Chimer stayed behind to practice on the heavy bag. He pounded it with everything he had, sweat dripping down his face, Zack’s taunts echoing in his mind.  
"Some people are just born dangerous… One day, someone’s gonna clean up that mess!"

He hit the bag harder, faster, until suddenly—crack—the bag split open, sand spilling onto the mat.

Marvin looked over, eyebrows raised. “You’ve got something special, Chimer. Don’t waste it.”

Chimer stared at his hands, breathless and confused. Was it just adrenaline, or something more? He didn’t know. But for the first time, he felt strong—not just in his body, but in his resolve.

That evening, back at Nell’s apartment, Chimer found his friends gathered around the kitchen table, sharing takeout and stories from their day. Midori was laughing at something Nell had said, her earlier fear replaced by a tentative smile. Chimer joined them, feeling a warmth he hadn’t felt in a long time.

As the night wore on, Chimer stepped out onto the balcony, looking out over the city. The rain had stopped, and the lights below twinkled like stars. He took a deep breath, feeling the strength in his arms, the steadiness in his heart.

He wasn’t alone anymore. He had people to protect, and now, maybe, the strength to do it.

Tomorrow, he would train again. Tomorrow, he would face whatever came next. But tonight, for the first time in a long while, Chimer allowed himself to hope.
