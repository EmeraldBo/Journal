Author's Note: The posters in the Chapter 6 and 7 Ending images feature the Twitch streamers PaldAquila and emibbuns. Why did I add these streamers to the book? For PaldAquila, I've promoted my book to her on chat and now im just waiting for her to read it and hopefully see herself on the book, which would be a bit funny for me. For emibbuns, I've done the same thing as PaldAquila, but also because I subbed to her for her cuteness (lmao). Both streamers put extensive effort to their works and I think you should follow them! <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/paldaquila">PaldAquila</a> <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/emibbuns">emibbuns</a>

I'm praying I dont get a DM from these streamers :D
