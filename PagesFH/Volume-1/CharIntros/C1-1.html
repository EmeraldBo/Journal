Chimer
A young 18 year old man, tired and depressed, working as a professional programmer at Pixlbyte Studios. His skills in coding are above many in his company, but his laziness and depression has caused him to tumble down.

His past was a gruesome one, losing his parents and the rest of his family members right in front of his eyes when he was young. Leaving home, he had to learn the hard ways of life by himself. At his school, he used to socialize and make friends all the time, only to completely stop and distance himself after two occuring incidents, one of which was the loss of his parents.
