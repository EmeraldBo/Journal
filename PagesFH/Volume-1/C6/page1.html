<h1>Chapter 6: Im Confused</h1>
As soon as he started thinking about the potential reasons why the unknown people were trying to save him, police sirens start blaring outside his apartment. Slowly, the ceiling starts reflecting red and blue light coming from the vehicles. At that moment, Chimer took Midori's hand and runs outside, planning to avoid the police so he wouldn't be seen as a suspect for the murder that had happened a couple minutes ago.

"We need to go!" Chimer panics as he storms out of the apartment with Midori.

"W- wait-!" Midori yelps as she is yanked out of the apartment with Chimer.
