"C- crap! Quickly, get on my shoulders." Chimer whispers to Midori as Midori nods and climbs onto him, feet on his shoulders.

Midori struggles to get up the fence, but manages to go over it and unlock it for Chimer.

"Chimer, quick!" Midori whispers.

Chimer swiftly passes through the door as Midori follows Chimer through the streets. As they ran, they came across an officer searching for them. The two immediately leapt to a nearby dumpster, hiding behind it to avoid being seen.

As the officer walks past, he mentions something important. With Chimer listening, he overears something shocking.
