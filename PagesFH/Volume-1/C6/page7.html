After a brief period of silence, a sudden knock echoed through the apartment. The three of them froze, exchanging nervous glances. Chimer instinctively moved toward the door, his heart pounding. He peered through the peephole, half-expecting to see police or another group of strangers. Instead, he saw a familiar face—Lena, standing in the hallway, her hair damp from the drizzle outside.

Chimer opened the door cautiously. “Lena?”

Nell nodded, ushering Lena inside. “We’re fine. Just shaken up.”
