As soon as he started thinking about the potential reasons why the unknown people were trying to save him, police sirens start blaring outside his apartment. Slowly, the ceiling starts reflecting red and blue light coming from the vehicles. At that moment, Chimer took Midori's hand and runs outside, planning to avoid the police so he wouldn't be seen as a suspect for the murder that had happened a couple minutes ago.

"We need to go!" Chimer panics as he storms out of the apartment with Midori.

"W- wait-!" Midori yelps as she is yanked out of the apartment with Chimer.

Chimer's thoughts race: “Why are they here already? Did someone see Sah? Did the corpses alert them? Am I being framed?”

Chimer and Midori sneak around the building, avoiding anything that could make noise as not to arouse the attention of the police who were nearby.

Midori struggles to keep up and whispers. “Chimer, do you even know where we’re going?”

“Yeah. Nell’s. She’ll understand.” Chimer whispers back as he leads Midori into a nearby alleyway.

Chimer could make out the noise of dogs barking and police officers chatting behind him, as well as see flashlights flickering by. They eventually come across a tall, fenced gate, where they need to climb up and unlock the gate from the other side.

"C- crap! Quickly, get on my shoulders." Chimer whispers to Midori as Midori nods and climbs onto him, feet on his shoulders.

Midori struggles to get up the fence, but manages to go over it and unlock it for Chimer.

"Chimer, quick!" Midori whispers.

Chimer swiftly passes through the door as Midori follows Chimer through the streets. As they ran, they came across an officer searching for them. The two immediately leapt to a nearby dumpster, hiding behind it to avoid being seen.

As the officer walks past, he mentions something important. With Chimer listening, he overears something shocking.

“Him again? Guy’s already locked up. Said he had nothing to do with this one.” The officer says as his voice fades away in the distance.

Chimer, confused from the officer's statement, stands up with Midori and comes out from behind the dumpster before immediately sprinting off with her.

Twenty minutes later, their knuckles rapped against a familiar metal door. Chimer knocked on the door, waiting for a response. One knock, two knocks, just utter silence. Chimer knocked on the door for a third time and finally, Nell answered in sleep clothes, eyes wide.

“Chimer? Midori?”

“We need a place to stay,” Chimer said, panting. “Something went wrong.”

Nell didn’t ask. Seeing their unchanged attire, sweat on their faces, and hearing their panting, she stepped aside.

Inside, the room was small, but warm. Bookshelves leaned under their weight. A mug of cold tea sat untouched by the window.

Chimer paced with stress while Midori sank into the couch.

“They broke in,” Chimer muttered. “Those men weren’t random. They knew Sah was there.”

Nell's eyes narrowed. “Sah…?”

“He said he used to be human. A Voider now. Whatever that means.” Chimer paused. “He didn’t seem surprised by the attack. He killed them. All of them.”

Midori added, still trembling as she stood up from the couch, “He didn’t even blink. Like he’d done it a hundred times before.”

Nell sat back, processing. “That’s... a lot. Do you think someone tipped them off?”

Chimer didn’t answer. His mind was already on Zack.

After a brief period of silence, a sudden knock echoed through the apartment. The three of them froze, exchanging nervous glances. Chimer instinctively moved toward the door, his heart pounding. He peered through the peephole, half-expecting to see police or another group of strangers. Instead, he saw a familiar face—Lena, standing in the hallway, her hair damp from the drizzle outside.

Chimer opened the door cautiously. “Lena?”

She offered a tired smile. “Hey. Sorry to drop by so late. I… I heard what happened. Are you all okay?”

Nell nodded, ushering Lena inside. “We’re fine. Just shaken up.”

Lena stepped in, glancing around the cramped room. She set her bag down and took a seat, her expression serious. “I came to tell you what I know about the incident at Pixlbyte Studios. The police have been questioning everyone. They think Zack was involved, but he’s already in custody.”

Chimer’s brow furrowed. “Zack? But… he was at the station when all this happened.”

Lena nodded. “That’s what he keeps saying. He claims he had nothing to do with this one. But the police don’t believe him. They think he’s hiding something.”

Midori, still pale from the night’s events, asked quietly, “Did Zack say anything else?”

Lena hesitated, then nodded. “Yeah. Before they took him away, he said something strange: ‘Some people are just born dangerous. Not because they want to be—just because the world doesn’t know what to do with them. One day, someone’s gonna clean up that mess!’”

The words hung in the air, heavy and unsettling. Chimer stared at the floor, his mind racing. Was Zack talking about him? About Sah? Or about the people who attacked them?

Nell broke the silence. “So what now? We can’t stay here forever. If those people are after us, we need a plan.”

Chimer clenched his fists, feeling a mix of fear and determination. “I’m done running. I need to be ready if they come again. I can’t let anyone else get hurt because of me.”

Midori looked at him, concern in her eyes. “What are you going to do?”

He took a deep breath. “I’m going to train. Not for revenge—just to protect the people I care about. I can’t rely on luck or on others saving me anymore.”

Lena managed a small smile. “That’s the Chimer I remember. Just… don’t do anything reckless, okay?”

He nodded, feeling a new resolve settle in his chest. The memories of the attack, Sah’s warning, Lena’s fear, and even Zack’s twisted smirk all swirled in his mind. For the first time, he felt a sense of purpose—not just to survive, but to fight for those still standing beside him.

As the rain tapped against the window and the city lights flickered in the distance, Chimer sat with his friends, quietly planning his next steps. Tomorrow, he would begin preparing himself for whatever came next. But tonight, he allowed himself a moment of rest, surrounded by the people who mattered most.
