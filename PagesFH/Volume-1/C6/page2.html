Chimer's thoughts race: “Why are they here already? Did someone see Sah? Did the corpses alert them? Am I being framed?”

Chimer and Midori sneak around the building, avoiding anything that could make noise as not to arouse the attention of the police who were nearby.

Midori struggles to keep up and whispers. “Chimer, do you even know where we’re going?”

“Yeah. Nell’s. She’ll understand.” Chimer whispers back as he leads Midori into a nearby alleyway.

Chimer could make out the noise of dogs barking and police officers chatting behind him, as well as see flashlights flickering by. They eventually come across a tall, fenced gate, where they need to climb up and unlock the gate from the other side.
