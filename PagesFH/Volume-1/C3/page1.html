<h1>Chapter 3: I Saw Her</h1>

"...so? Why are you here?" Chimer asks Nell with no emotion, not even a smile or a tone that says otherwise.

"Well... I was just passing by after my work," Nell responds as she sits beside Chimer on the bench.

"Work? You work now?" Chimer asks with intrigue, curious to know about her job.

"Yeah, I work at a fast food restaurant. What about you?" Nell asks with curiosity.

"...Pixlbyte Studios," Chimer responds reluctantly, expecting her not to care as he shifts his focus to the ground.
