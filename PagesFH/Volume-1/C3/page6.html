"Chimer, huh? How cute... You can call me Ketsueki." Ketsueki introduces herself calmly, finding Chimer's nervousness cute.

"Ah, I see... N... Nice to meet you, I guess..." Chimer nervously tries to keep the conversation going as he searches for the words.

Chimer and Nell then notice the long, black katana at Ketsueki's waist and get curious.

"What's that katana for?" Chimer asks.

Ketsueki looks down at her katana and chuckles. "Why, this is for training. Why do you ask?"

"Oh, nothing," Chimer responds.
