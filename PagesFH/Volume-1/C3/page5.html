Chimer and Nell follow the woman through the city, her red attire making her stand out from any crowd.

As Chimer finally approaches the woman, he speaks. "Hey! Haven't we met..."

The woman quickly turns around as Chimer speaks. As her long hair moves out of the way, Chimer is flabbergasted by her unnatural beauty. "...before..?" he says, stunned by her appearance.

"Huh? Who are you?" the woman asks with curiosity, not expecting someone to approach her.

"I'm... C-Chimer..." Chimer introduces himself nervously.
