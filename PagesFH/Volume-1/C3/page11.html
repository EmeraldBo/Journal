<h1>Chapter 3 // END</h1>




Author's Note: I kind of rushed this chapter so it may be a bit short. I may try to put more effort to Chapter 4 and extend Chapter 3. I'm also trying to find out how to make the book easier to read on mobile, since I've gotten feedback that it was hard to read on smaller devices. Thanks for reading by the way, remember to comment your thoughts down below!
