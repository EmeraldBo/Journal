"Life was so fun back then, wasn't it? All of that joy is now replaced by stress from work. Haa..." Nell sighs and leans back on the bench. "...I still remember what you did to me back then..."

Chimer tilts his head in confusion. "What..?"

Nell's cheeks flush red as she looks at Chimer. "Really, you don't remember? Don't make me say it."

"Okay." Chimer gives up his curiosity.

Nell looks at the ground as she speaks. "...you kissed me back then."
