"Waitâ€”! Ugh..." Chimer gives up the attempt to chase her down as he looks in the direction Ketsueki went.

"...I have a weird feeling about this," he says as he starts walking in that direction, holding the card in hand.

He passes by several advertisements for plushies that wear suits and have bacon-like hair, and posters of one black and green egg holding two black swords while wearing a crown designed with dominos.

After a while, he finds himself at a small forest with a small shed in the distance; the sounds of gunshots fill the air.

"What was that?!" Chimer jumps in terror at the noise, wanting to run away. However, a familiar and clear voice speaks to him.

"Keep going..."
