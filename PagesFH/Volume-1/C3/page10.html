"H... Huh?" Chimer confusedly opens his eyes as Ketsueki leans close to his face, taking his chin and making his heartbeat skyrocket.

"I told you to call me if you need me, silly." She gives a smile and a wink before letting go and walking toward a tree. "Remember that, darling~" she says before walking behind the tree and disappearing.

Chimer is utterly dumbfounded. Two impossible occurrences happening before his eyes in the span of just one week. He stands up and flees the scene.

As Chimer roams the streets, a thought reigns on its throne in his mind: "I am going to find out who those two really are."
