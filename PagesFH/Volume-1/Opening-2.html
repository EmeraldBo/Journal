The horizons crack under time's gaze,
fractured echoes of a world once alone.
Now, in the twilight of forgotten days,
a new dawn rises, a tale to be sown.

The Fractured Horizons, a multi-multiverse vast,
where every thought branches into the unknown.
A tapestry woven from futures and past,
where dreams and realities intertwine and have grown.

- The Emperor of the Clock, now passed on.
