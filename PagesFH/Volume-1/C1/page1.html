Chapter 1: I Woke Up

...

...Truly a wonderful dream...

...A dream full of darkness...

...until a light shines through the cracks of darkness...

...Then a figure, standing happily in the light before the light flickers out, leaving only the sillhouette of the figure...

The next second passes and a spike erupts from the ground and cleanly pierces the figure's heart, leaving a trail of blood on it. Then another sillhouette appears with the ears of a fox, only to be chained up and mercilessly shot. Another appears, but gets his head cut in half at such a specific angle. This one was interesting... another figure but with a flaming head. Unfortunately, this one gets his torso cut cleanly in a cross shape before desintegrating into nothingness.
