A couple hours pass as the train arrives at the station. Chimer starts walking towards the exit, passing by a few people who are also getting off the train. However, he passes by a particular woman with a mysterious, yet calming aura. She wore red attire, a combination of a Japanese kimono and modern trends. She also had long, blood-red hair.

Chimer wanted to catch a glimpse of her face, but the doors suddenly shut close and the train starts moving again, leaving him behind.

He sighs, "Guess I'll never see her again...".
