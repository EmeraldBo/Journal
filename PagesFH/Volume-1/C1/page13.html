As Zack walks by Chimer, he purposely bumps into him, spilling some of Chimer's coffee on his shirt. "Oops, my bad," Zack says with a smirk, clearly enjoying the moment.

Chimer clenches his jaw, trying to keep his temper in check. "Watch it, Zack," he replies, wiping the coffee off his shirt with a tissue.

Zack chuckles, "Relax, it's just coffee. You need to lighten up a bit." He walks away, leaving Chimer fuming.

Chimer takes a deep breath, trying to calm himself down. He knows that Zack is just trying to get under his skin, but it still irritates him. He returns to his desk and starts working on the project assigned to him, focusing on the code and trying to ignore Zack's taunts.
