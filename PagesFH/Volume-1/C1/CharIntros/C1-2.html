Zack  
Chimer’s co-worker and self-proclaimed rival, Zack is a sharp-tongued presence in the office, always quick with a biting remark or a mocking laugh. Beneath his confident swagger lies a competitive streak that borders on obsession—he seems to take special pleasure in targeting Chimer, pushing his buttons with unrelenting taunts and subtle sabotage. Zack’s bullying isn’t just casual workplace banter; it’s calculated, personal, and often crosses the line into cruelty. He knows exactly how to twist Chimer’s insecurities, using every opportunity to undermine his confidence and isolate him from others.

Despite his antagonistic behavior, Zack is undeniably talented at his job, which only fuels his arrogance and the resentment of those around him. Some say he’s driven by jealousy, others by a need to prove himself superior. Whatever the reason, Zack’s actions have left a lasting mark on Chimer, deepening his depression and making the workplace feel more like a battlefield than a place of growth. Yet, behind Zack’s bravado, there are hints of his own struggles—moments when his mask slips, revealing a glimpse of vulnerability that he quickly buries beneath another cruel joke.
