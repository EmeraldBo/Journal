"WHAAH- Wh... what was that..?"

The young man jumped off his bed and spoke, beads of sweat dripping from his face as he looked around to find himself back in his room.

"Was that a dream..? A nightmare..? Or..."

He looks to his side, seeing his clock showing "6:42 AM, MONDAY".

"...oh god fucking dammit."

He slams his hand on the clock, causing it to stop ticking. Next, he lazily gets up from bed and heads to the bathroom, passing by a picture of himself in the past, smiling with energy. A note is placed on the picture: "Chimer"

He enters the bathroom, splashes water on his face, and stares at himself in the mirror. His eyes are tired, and his hair is a mess.
