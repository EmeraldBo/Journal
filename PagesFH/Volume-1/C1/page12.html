"Tch, that bastard." Chimer said in annoyance.

He stands up, irritated from the email as he walked over to the coffee dispenser. He takes a cup and starts pouring coffee into it, but then Zack enters the office and leans against the wall near Chimer.

"Oh, look who it is. It's the boss' little baby Chimer"

Chimer rolls his eyes, not bothering to respond at first. He sips his coffee, then glances at Zack.

"Don't you have work to do, Zack?" he retorts, trying to keep his tone even.

Zack smirks, pushing off the wall. "Just making sure you don't mess up the coffee machine again."
