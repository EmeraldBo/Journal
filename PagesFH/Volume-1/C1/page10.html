After witnessing the mysterious aura of the woman on the train, Chimer felt a strange pull towards her. He couldn't shake off the feeling that their paths were meant to cross again.

However, he had work to do. Chimer was a skilled programmer, able to program in multiple languages and create complex systems but was just too lazy to do so. He had a job at a tech company that specialized in developing AI systems.

After arriving at the building, he was greeted by the optimistic receptionist, who always had a smile on her face.

"Good morning, Chimer! Ready for another day of coding?" she asked cheerfully.
