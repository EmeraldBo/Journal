Seconds, minutes, and hours pass as Chimer works on his project, trying to ignore Zack's taunts. He focuses on the code, typing away at the keyboard, trying to make sense of the complex algorithms and systems he was working on.

Eventually, the manager notices him alone in the dark office at midnight. He cant help but feel a sense of worry from Chimer's dedication to his work.

"That poor boy... he's been working all day again..." the manager mutters as he returns to his office.

As he gently closes the door behind him, not all the way, the manager searches around his office until he finds a briefcase. Opening it, he reveals bonds of cash stacked neatly inside.
