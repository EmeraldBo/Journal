Outside, Chimer wonders, "Where should I find clues..?" He wanders aimlessly for a while, the city’s neon lights casting long shadows. Eventually, he finds himself near Pixlbyte Studios, drawn to the same alleyway where so much had already happened. Something glints behind a pile of garbage, catching his eye. He approaches cautiously, heart pounding, and discovers a shining white cloth. The memory of the man in white who saved him flashes through his mind.

"White..." Chimer murmurs, reaching out. As his hand nears the cloth, a sudden gust of energy pushes him back, nearly knocking him off his feet.

"Gck-!" he grunts, bracing himself against the invisible force. But determination wins out—he pushes forward, finally grabbing the cloth. Instantly, a strange sensation surges through his veins, as if the cloth itself is alive with power.
