Chimer lets out a sigh of relief. "Oh, Midori. You look like you just woke up tonight."

Midori blinks, then notices the paper at her feet. "Hm? What's this?" She picks up the note and squints at the messy handwriting. "'Ketsueki... murdered 26 people at once..?'" she reads aloud, her tone shifting from sleepy to suspicious.

Chimer’s heart skips a beat as Midori questions him, her eyes narrowing. "Who's this Ketsueki? And why would they kill these people?" she asks, her voice now sharp and alert.

He hesitates, searching for an answer, but only silence escapes his lips. He doesn’t want her to know what he’s gotten himself into.
