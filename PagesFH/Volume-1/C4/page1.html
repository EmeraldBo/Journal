<h1>Chapter 4: I'm Curious</h1>

Chimer walks back home late at night, the city lights flickering in the distance as his footsteps echo along the empty sidewalk. He is visibly tired, yet a determined glint remains in his eyesâ€”he is set on discovering the identities of the two mysterious figures. Once inside his apartment, he locks the door behind him, the familiar click offering a small sense of security. He heads straight to his room, sinking into the creaky chair at his desk. The room is dim, illuminated only by the pale glow of his desk lamp. Taking out a piece of paper and a pen, he quickly scribbles down his experiences, desperate to capture every detail before they fade from memory.
