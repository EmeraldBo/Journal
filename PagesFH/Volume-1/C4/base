Chimer walks back home late at night, the city lights flickering in the distance as his footsteps echo along the empty sidewalk. He is visibly tired, yet a determined glint remains in his eyes—he is set on discovering the identities of the two mysterious figures. Once inside his apartment, he locks the door behind him, the familiar click offering a small sense of security. He heads straight to his room, sinking into the creaky chair at his desk. The room is dim, illuminated only by the pale glow of his desk lamp. Taking out a piece of paper and a pen, he quickly scribbles down his experiences, desperate to capture every detail before they fade from memory.

Just then, the silence is broken. Midori, his roommate, shuffles into the dark room, wearing an oversized shirt and short shorts. She flips the light switch, flooding the room with harsh brightness and catching Chimer off guard. Her eyes are half-closed, and she looks like she hasn’t slept for several nights—her hair is as wild and tangled as a bush.

"WHa-!? Who's there!?" Chimer exclaims in a panic, scrambling to hide his notes among the clutter on his desk. In his haste, a sheet of paper slips from his grasp and glides to the floor, landing right in front of Midori.

"Relax, it's just me, Chimer," Midori says, her voice thick with sleep as she rubs her eyes.

Chimer lets out a sigh of relief. "Oh, Midori. You look like you just woke up tonight."

Midori blinks, then notices the paper at her feet. "Hm? What's this?" She picks up the note and squints at the messy handwriting. "'Ketsueki... murdered 26 people at once..?'" she reads aloud, her tone shifting from sleepy to suspicious.

Chimer’s heart skips a beat as Midori questions him, her eyes narrowing. "Who's this Ketsueki? And why would they kill these people?" she asks, her voice now sharp and alert.

He hesitates, searching for an answer, but only silence escapes his lips. He doesn’t want her to know what he’s gotten himself into.

Midori sighs, shaking her head as she places the note back on his desk. "Whatever, it seems like you're just writing some weird fictional story. I'm gonna go get some coffee," she mutters, shuffling out of the room.

Chimer watches her leave, then stands up and hurriedly locks the door behind her. He glances at his notes, anxiety gnawing at him. "I need to find more clues about them," he thinks. He gathers his notes and stuffs them into his briefcase, his mind racing with possibilities.

As he passes by Midori in the kitchen, she calls out, "Where are you going this late..?"

"...Just going for a walk," Chimer replies, trying to sound casual as he glances over his shoulder. He opens the door and slips out into the night, the city’s chill air biting at his skin.

Outside, Chimer wonders, "Where should I find clues..?" He wanders aimlessly for a while, the city’s neon lights casting long shadows. Eventually, he finds himself near Pixlbyte Studios, drawn to the same alleyway where so much had already happened. Something glints behind a pile of garbage, catching his eye. He approaches cautiously, heart pounding, and discovers a shining white cloth. The memory of the man in white who saved him flashes through his mind.

"White..." Chimer murmurs, reaching out. As his hand nears the cloth, a sudden gust of energy pushes him back, nearly knocking him off his feet.

"Gck-!" he grunts, bracing himself against the invisible force. But determination wins out—he pushes forward, finally grabbing the cloth. Instantly, a strange sensation surges through his veins, as if the cloth itself is alive with power.

"Such... such tremendous power..." Chimer whispers, staring at the cloth in awe and fear. "He must be really powerful..." he thinks, quickly stuffing the cloth into his briefcase before anyone can see.

His next destination is the forest, the site of the recent murders and the last place he saw Ketsueki. The trees loom ahead, their branches swaying in the wind like silent sentinels. Chimer hesitates at the edge, fear gnawing at him—what if the secret group is still out for revenge? But he steels himself and steps into the darkness.

The forest is eerily quiet, every snap of a twig underfoot making his heart race. He retraces his steps to the spot where Ketsueki vanished. Examining the tree trunk, he finds nothing at first, but as he circles the tree, a faint white glow catches his eye—a mark, pulsing softly. He reaches out and touches it, but nothing happens. Then, he notices a light shining from his briefcase.

Realizing the connection, Chimer pulls out the cloth and holds it up to the mark. The moment the two make contact, the world around him dissolves. He is transported into a swirling void, weightless and disoriented. Four figures materialize before him: Ketsueki, the man in white, a man in black with a flaming head, and a woman in green with fox-like ears. The man in black turns, white streaks stretching across his features like eyes.

Before Chimer can react, he is yanked back to reality. The forest reappears around him, the cloth and the glowing mark both gone. He stands there, breathless and shaken, realizing that these people are eerily similar to those in his dreams from several nights ago. Clutching his briefcase, he sprints home, desperate to record everything before the memories fade.

As he hurries through the city, he can’t shake the feeling that someone is following him. Every shadow seems to move, every footstep echoes a little too long. He glances over his shoulder, but sees nothing. Still, the unease lingers. He finally hails a taxi, sinking into the back seat with a sigh of relief as the city blurs past the window.

Arriving at his apartment, Chimer unlocks the door and slips inside, double-checking the lock behind him. He heads to his room, tossing his briefcase onto the bed and spreading his notes across the desk. His stomach growls, reminding him that he hasn’t eaten since lunch, so he heads to the kitchen.

On his way, he hears a deep, rhythmic snoring from the living room. He peeks in and finds Midori sprawled across the couch, a blanket tangled around her legs and arms flung in every direction. Despite everything, Chimer can’t help but smile. He gently spreads the blanket over her, tucking her in as best he can.

Just as he turns to leave, a voice—soft, almost whispering—calls out to him, making him freeze in place, a bead of sweat trickling down his neck.

"Welcome home."
