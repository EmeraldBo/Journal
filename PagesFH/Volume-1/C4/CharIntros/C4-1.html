Lena
The receptionist standing and waiting for Chimer everyday. She is the only one Chimer talks to from time to time, other than his manager. She, together with Chimer's manager, take care of Chimer for when he's stressed or when his emotions go wild.

Nell
Chimer's friend and old schoolmate from Eldercrest Academy. Back in her years at the academy, she was mean and rejecting to Chimer. However, she managed to ease up and turn sweet and kind to him once they met again. Nell now works in the popular fast food restaurant, BiteRush, where she serves customers as a waitress.
