The forest is eerily quiet, every snap of a twig underfoot making his heart race. He retraces his steps to the spot where Ketsueki vanished. Examining the tree trunk, he finds nothing at first, but as he circles the tree, a faint white glow catches his eyeâ€”a mark, pulsing softly. He reaches out and touches it, but nothing happens.

He is transported into a swirling void, weightless and disoriented. Four figures materialize before him: Ketsueki, the man in white, a man in black with a flaming head, and a woman in green with fox-like ears. The man in black turns, white streaks stretching across his features like eyes.
