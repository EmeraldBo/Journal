Just then, the silence is broken. Midori, his roommate, shuffles into the dark room, wearing an oversized shirt and short shorts. She flips the light switch, flooding the room with harsh brightness and catching Chimer off guard. Her eyes are half-closed, and she looks like she hasn’t slept for several nights—her hair is as wild and tangled as a bush.

"WHa-!? Who's there!?" Chimer exclaims in a panic, scrambling to hide his notes among the clutter on his desk. In his haste, a sheet of paper slips from his grasp and glides to the floor, landing right in front of Midori.

"Relax, it's just me, Chimer," Midori says, her voice thick with sleep as she rubs her eyes.
