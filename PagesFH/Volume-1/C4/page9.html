Arriving at his apartment, Chimer unlocks the door and slips inside, double-checking the lock behind him. He heads to his room, tossing his briefcase onto the bed and spreading his notes across the desk. His stomach growls, reminding him that he hasn’t eaten since lunch, so he heads to the kitchen.

On his way, he hears a deep, rhythmic snoring from the living room. He peeks in and finds Midori sprawled across the couch, a blanket tangled around her legs and arms flung in every direction. Despite everything, Chimer can’t help but smile. He gently spreads the blanket over her, tucking her in as best he can.
