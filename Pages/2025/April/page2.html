Man. She said we were gonna meet in 5 years. That long??? *SIGHHHHHH* i have to be patient about this, maybe i could be rewarded with a kiss or maybe... yeah, i cant write that here.

I have something to confess to myself. I think I like Danielle more than Umirah (yes, she revealed her name to me.) Though, i dont really want to break my girlfriend's heart so I'll just have to keep this in here and in my head.
