I understand that you don't want it, but i just cant control it yknow? I... Im just really in need of physical attention from others. Not from my parents, or relatives, but people i actually adore and love, like you and pixel for example. I... I understand you think that it may cause problems for my relationship with Pixel, and yes, i do want to hug her, kiss her, cuddle with her and stuff, but she's just out of my reach, really. So im just thinking, since you're here, i thought i could just satisfy my needs with you instead. I mean, Pixel understands... right..?
