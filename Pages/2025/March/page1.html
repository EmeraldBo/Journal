So, there's this random person i met in Write a Letter named Pixel, and with her her friend named Chamble. They're pretty nice not gonna lie, they friendly.

Just came into my long abandoned discord server, abandoned due to the disappearance of Alexa but i guess a bit alive now. Man, I wonder what's gonna happen next.
