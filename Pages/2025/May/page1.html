Practices started and im starting to not go to school. Mostly because im just lazy, but also because im tired, exhausted, SPENT. Like, im already a batch behind in my requirements, what's the point?

IM AT FUCKING PANGASINAN RIGHT NOW, STOP MAKING ME FUCKING THINK ABOUT THE PRACTICE AND LET ME CLEAR MY GODDAMN HEAD! What's this, you're mad too? HAH, Try and match my rage. I'll bash your head against a rock.
