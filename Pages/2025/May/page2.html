*sigh* after basically coinflipping my going to school, i finally arrived for practices. Honestly, i knew the first steps, but they advanced so much without me i dont think i can keep up. Im still hung about what happened while i was in Pangasinan, will they forgive me for what i said? I dont know, either way i'll just practice for a little then leave right afterwards. I dont want to be a part of this mess anymore.
