2024

This was the year when I met the wonderful Clara. Or otherwise known as Hiromi, Ketsueki, or Alexa. She's such a wonderful person yet i cant help but want her to stop her coffee addiction and get some rest. This was also the time that The Universal Shenanigans was born, meant to be a private group chat between us AUT (A Universal Time) players.
