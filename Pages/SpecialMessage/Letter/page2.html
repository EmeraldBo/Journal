To Umairah, my dear girlfriend. You've been a great, understanding person for me for these two months we've been together. You've made me laugh, made me smile, and vice versa. I apologize deeply for being pushy over what i want, im just very impatient, wanting to just have you in my arms this instant. I want to feel you, physically. Though i said i didnt like you very much, and yes, i am sorry for that, i still care for you and still see you as my girlfriend.
