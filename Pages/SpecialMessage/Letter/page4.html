To Danielle, my loving friend. We've known each other since elementary, even though my only memory of you is just you hugging me and us jumping after i said that "i'll still stay in this school." You've supported me throughout my life up until now, just being by my side and staying in contact with me like how i did the same for when you cried. The life i have now wouldn't be the same if you were not there.
