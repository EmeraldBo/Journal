I may not be able to tell this to you directly, but yes, i still do like you despite already having a girlfriend. Earlier, when we were texting, i was crying desperately inside myself even though no tears flowed out of my eyes. I wanted a hug, a kiss, something to let me know that my one year of liking you was not a waste. However, knowing that i had attempted to assault you, i know it wont happen, and my efforts of building trust would just go to waste anyway. So, you dont have to respond.
