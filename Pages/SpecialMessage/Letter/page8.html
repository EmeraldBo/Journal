To Athena, my friend. Im sorry. If you hate me right now, you have every right to stab me in my heart and kill me. I know being touchy with Danielle was... bad, to say the least... but, by leaving this message now... well, i dont know who's going to relay this message to you. Maybe Qief? Or Danielle perhaps? Im not sure, but just read this message for me, and forgive me. Please. Thank you.
