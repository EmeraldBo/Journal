To Keppie Qief, my brother. My homie, my comrade. If you are reading this, i just want to thank you for all the advice you gave me. However, I wont be able to use them anyway. It's not your fault, but mine. Im just blinded by my insanity that Im not able to see the opportunities to use these advices. Still, i appreciate them.
