I... I kissed Danielle... God it felt so good, but... I have a feeling that she won't like any of that at all...

I hope she'd forgive me for that... I lost my control over my body just seeing her vulnerable, defenseless state... God I regret this now...

This was the year when I met the wonderful Clara. Or otherwise known as Hiromi, Ketsueki, or Alexa. She's such a wonderful person yet i cant help but want her to stop her coffee addiction and get some rest. This was also the time that The Universal Shenanigans was born, meant to be a private group chat between us AUT (A Universal Time) players.

During my summer vacation, I went ahead and revisited my old passion from 10 year old me, Sticknodes animating. I was practically shit, honestly. However, I managed to make an animation good enough for my youtube channel.
</pre>
</div>

      <div class="page">
<pre>
Wow, I... dont really believe it but I reached 100 subscribers in no time. Quite unexpected too was that my 7 second kabedon.mp4 video reached 2k views. Somehow... i became a youtuber.

I dont really know what happened but Alexa just suddenly disappeared. I dont know where she went or why she disappeared. I just hope she comes back with some answers.

It's my birthday, and i do not feel good at all. I feel like complete shit, just thinking about Alexa and where she may be. Why did she just leave me like that?
</pre>
</div>
<div class="page">
<pre>
Just finished school, yelling and shit like back then. Though what really pissed me off was Satyen, yelling back at me. I dont know what ticked me off after that, maybe it was the noise? The more embarrassing part was the fact I limped over with my aunt towards the car going home. Like, god just fucking kill me already.
</pre>
</div>
<div class="page">
<pre>
Wow, two weeks and i've managed to get mad once again. To be honest, i dont remember what happened but all i remember is choking  Satyen, him going to Shawn, and hearing about how Shawn's gonna beat me up if i ever do choke him again. Fucking kill me already.

edit: we forgave eachother (yippee i guess)

Valentines? ...maybe i have someone in mind. I dont know why but I have a feeling that I have fallen in love with Danielle. I know Im speaking to myself, and that's good because i dont want anyone to know... unless im an obvious person.

So, there's this random person i met in Write a Letter named Pixel, and with her her friend named Chamble. They're pretty nice not gonna lie, they friendly.

Just came into my long abandoned discord server, abandoned due to the disappearance of Alexa but i guess a bit alive now. Man, I wonder what's gonna happen next.
</pre>
</div>
<div class="page">
<pre>
Im starting to like two people now. Danielle and Pixel. GOD WHAT IS GOING ON??? Like, man i dont know what to do...

Welp, news breaker, she confessed to me. Honestly, i didn't like her that much since i was single for the past 3 years, having no hope on having a girlfriend. However, i thought about it.

"What if i like her later?"

And so, I "confessed" to her back for this reason, and the fact that i just wanted a girlfriend to be with me.
</pre>
</div>
<div class="page">
<pre>
Man. She said we were gonna meet in 5 years. That long??? *SIGHHHHHH* i have to be patient about this, maybe i could be rewarded with a kiss or maybe... yeah, i cant write that here.

I have something to confess to myself. I think I like Danielle more than Umirah (yes, she revealed her name to me.) Though, i dont really want to break my girlfriend's heart so I'll just have to keep this in here and in my head.

May 2025

Practices started and im starting to not go to school. Mostly because im just lazy, but also because im tired, exhausted, SPENT. Like, im already a batch behind in my requirements, what's the point?

IM AT FUCKING PANGASINAN RIGHT NOW, STOP MAKING ME FUCKING THINK ABOUT THE PRACTICE AND LET ME CLEAR MY GODDAMN HEAD! What's this, you're mad too? HAH, Try and match my rage. I'll bash your head against a rock.
</pre>
</div>
<div class="page">
<pre>
*sigh* after basically coinflipping my going to school, i finally arrived for practices. Honestly, i knew the first steps, but they advanced so much without me i dont think i can keep up. Im still hung about what happened while i was in Pangasinan, will they forgive me for what i said? I dont know, either way i'll just practice for a little then leave right afterwards. I dont want to be a part of this mess anymore.
</pre>
</div>
<div class="page">
<pre>
Woah, what is this? For the first time in a while, Danielle's initiating the hugs, letting me hold her hand, and supporting me? God is this a fever dream or something? Idk anymore man, i guess ill just enjoy this warmth for a lil bit.
</pre>
</div>
<div class="page">
<pre>
Im starting to attend the practices more just for Danielle. Expecting her greetings, her warm hugs... god dont wake me up from this dream.

Whooh, School's over and im now able to do my own stuff! I can draw and animate my new content, program some new applications, make some music, WOOOOOOO-

Welp, this certainly got boring. I cant finish any of my personal projects, and i just want to go sleep and shit.

Present. (June 2, 2025)

If you are reading this, congratulations. You've solved a puzzle that i have programmed overnight. If you are wondering about my current state..

Im going insane. I dont know what to do. I want to hurt myself, feel pain, but at the same time i dont. I've been going to therapy for the past several months, but i dont feel the benefits of it.

To Umairah, my dear girlfriend. You've been a great, understanding person for me for these two months we've been together. You've made me laugh, made me smile, and vice versa. I apologize deeply for being pushy over what i want, im just very impatient, wanting to just have you in my arms this instant. I want to feel you, physically. Though i said i didnt like you very much, and yes, i am sorry for that, i still care for you and still see you as my girlfriend.
</pre>
</div>
<div class="page">
<pre>
Not because i want to, but because i've grown close to you this few months. I love you.
</pre>

To Danielle, my loving friend. We've known each other since elementary, even though my only memory of you is just you hugging me and us jumping after i said that "i'll still stay in this school." You've supported me throughout my life up until now, just being by my side and staying in contact with me like how i did the same for when you cried. The life i have now wouldn't be the same if you were not there. 
</pre>
</div>
<div class="page">
<pre>
I may not be able to tell this to you directly, but yes, i still do like you despite already having a girlfriend. Earlier, when we were texting, i was crying desperately inside myself even though no tears flowed out of my eyes. I wanted a hug, a kiss, something to let me know that my one year of liking you was not a waste. However, knowing that i had attempted to assault you, i know it wont happen, and my efforts of building trust would just go to waste anyway. So, you dont have to respond.
</pre>
</div>
<div class="page">
<pre>
 I still love you deeply, but i think it's better to cut ties for now.

To Keppie Qief, my brother. My homie, my comrade. If you are reading this, i just want to thank you for all the advice you gave me. However, I wont be able to use them anyway. It's not your fault, but mine. Im just blinded by my insanity that Im not able to see the opportunities to use these advices. Still, i appreciate them.
</pre>
</div>
<div class="page">
<pre>
To Athena, my friend. Im sorry. If you hate me right now, you have every right to stab me in my heart and kill me. I know being touchy with Danielle was... bad, to say the least... but, by leaving this message now... well, i dont know who's going to relay this message to you. Maybe Qief? Or Danielle perhaps? Im not sure, but just read this message for me, and forgive me. Please. Thank you.

To all the others i hold dear. Once i return to school, expect my downfall, and do not support me whatsoever. It's meant to happen, said Fate, and we cannot do anything about it.

This is not a goodbye message, but just a journal i selectively shared among you, the readers. You will not be hearing about a funeral soon, so dont worry about that. However... you may witness the mentally and spiritually lowest time of my life. Stay safe.
